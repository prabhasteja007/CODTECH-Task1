# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Used Cars in the United States**

### **Project Overview**
- **Name:** Prabhas Teja Penugonda  
- **Company:** CODTECH IT Solutions  
- **ID:** CT6WDS1908  
- **Domain:** Data Science  
- **Duration:** September to October 2024  
- **Mentor:** Neela Santhosh Kumar  

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on used car listings** across the United States to uncover insights into car prices, conditions, brands, and other key variables through data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

---

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to perform **EDA on a dataset of used cars** to:
- Understand **distribution and trends** in car prices, brands, and conditions.
- **Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers** within the dataset.
- Gain insights that can help **buyers, sellers, or market analysts** make data-driven decisions.

---

## **Key Activities**
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Removed inconsistencies and missing values to ensure the data is suitable for analysis.
   - Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns to optimize performance.

2. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Created **box plots, histograms, bar charts**, and **scatter plots** to visualize data distributions, relationships, and patterns.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**  
   - Generated **heatmaps** to identify correlations between features like price, condition, and other variables.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python:** Primary language for data manipulation and visualization.
- **pandas:** Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **matplotlib:** For generating static and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn:** To create appealing statistical graphics.
